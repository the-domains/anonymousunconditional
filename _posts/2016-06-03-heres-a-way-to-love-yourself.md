<article style=""><h1>Here's a way to love yourself.</h1><p>You've been through a lot. You weren't expecting to find a friend, but you found this. Maybe this can give you a little bit of what you need, to carry on just a little bit further.</p></article>

And you know what? It's hard, what you're doing. 

There isn't anyone who really understands. That's part of being here.

But there is someone who knows the next step. 

That's you.

Don't worry --- it's not something any of us have really figured out. If you're reading this, you're not alone. A human being typed it, thinking of you. This is one light reaching out to another. 

There's a light in there, even if it's hard to feel.
